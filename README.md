# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project aims to segment mall customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques and descriptive statistics. By analyzing customer data on age, annual income, and spending score, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments for better marketing and business strategies.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales numerical features using StandardScaler.
- **Clustering**: Applies Hierarchical Clustering (Ward method) to identify clusters within the dataset, followed by flat clustering to form five segments.
- **PCA for Visualization**: Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space and create a 2D representation of the customer segments.
- **Cluster Interpretation**: Assigns descriptive labels to the segments based on the average characteristics of customers in each cluster, such as "High Income, High Spender" or "Young High Spender."

## Technologies Used:
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn (StandardScaler, PCA), scipy (linkage, fcluster)
- **Dataset**: Mall Customers dataset containing customer details, including Age, Income, and Spending Scores.

## Results:
The visualization highlights distinct customer segments, aiding in personalized marketing and sales strategies. The clusters provide insights that can be used to tailor campaigns for different customer groups, such as high-income individuals or younger consumers with high spending scores.
